# üóÑÔ∏è SQL Data Analysis Project: AtliQ Hardware Business Intelligence
## üìå Project Overview
This project demonstrates how SQL-driven analysis can generate actionable insights for AtliQ Hardware company. Using sales, customer, product, and supply chain data (2017‚Äì2022), I performed end-to-end business analysis to address challenges in:<br>
‚Ä¢	Revenue Optimization: Identifying underperforming markets/products and evaluating discount strategies.<br>
‚Ä¢	Market Expansion: Assessing India‚Äôs market potential as a growth driver.<br>
‚Ä¢	Forecast Accuracy & Supply Chain Efficiency: Reducing costs and stockouts through better demand forecasting.<br>
‚Ä¢	Customer & Product Insights: Segmenting customers, analyzing product mix, and identifying retention opportunities.<br>

üëâ The goal was to convert raw transactional data into strategic recommendations that drive growth, efficiency, and profitability.<br>

## üìä Key Analyses

### üîπ Financial Analysis<br>
‚Ä¢	APAC leads in total sales; India contributes significantly within APAC.<br>
‚Ä¢	Discounting impacts profitability differently across regions.<br>

Example Query ‚Äì Top 10 Markets by Net Sales<br>

SELECT c.market,<br>
       ROUND(SUM(s.sold_quantity * g.gross_price)/1000000, 2) AS net_sales_mln<br>
FROM fact_sales_monthly s<br>
JOIN dim_customer c ON s.customer_code = c.customer_code<br>
JOIN fact_gross_price g ON s.product_code = g.product_code<br>
                       AND s.fiscal_year = g.fiscal_year<br>
GROUP BY c.market<br>
ORDER BY net_sales_mln DESC<br>
LIMIT 10;<br>

### üîπ Customer Analysis<br>
‚Ä¢	Segmented customers into High (28%) / Medium (32%) / Low (40%) value.<br>
‚Ä¢	Medium-value customers offer the largest growth opportunity.<br>
‚Ä¢	E-commerce platforms like Amazon & Flipkart sustain 1500+ day customer lifetimes.<br>

Example Query ‚Äì Customer Segmentation by Revenue Contribution<br>

WITH customer_revenue AS (<br>
    SELECT c.customer_code,<br>
           c.customer,<br>
           SUM(s.sold_quantity * g.gross_price) AS total_revenue<br>
    FROM fact_sales_monthly s<br>
    JOIN dim_customer c ON s.customer_code = c.customer_code<br>
    JOIN fact_gross_price g ON s.product_code = g.product_code<br>
                           AND s.fiscal_year = g.fiscal_year<br>
    GROUP BY c.customer_code, c.customer<br>
)<br>
SELECT customer,<br>
       total_revenue,<br>
       CASE <br>
         WHEN total_revenue >= 100000000 THEN 'High Value'<br>
         WHEN total_revenue BETWEEN 50000000 AND 100000000 THEN 'Medium Value'<br>
         ELSE 'Low Value'<br>
       END AS customer_segment<br>
FROM customer_revenue<br>
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;<br>

### üîπ Product Analysis<br>
‚Ä¢	Computer peripherals (Mouse & Keyboards) lead sales (~70M units).<br>
‚Ä¢	Storage devices & high-performance components show strong demand.<br>
‚Ä¢	Smaller accessories highlight cross-selling opportunities.<br>

Example Query ‚Äì Top Products by Quantity Sold<br>

SELECT p.product,<br>
       ROUND(SUM(s.sold_quantity)/1000000, 2) AS qty_sold_mln<br>
FROM fact_sales_monthly s<br>
JOIN dim_product p ON s.product_code = p.product_code<br>
GROUP BY p.product<br>
ORDER BY qty_sold_mln DESC<br>
LIMIT 10;<br>

### üîπ India Market Deep Dive<br>
‚Ä¢	E-Commerce dominates (Amazon ‚Çπ240M+, Flipkart ‚Çπ108M).<br>
‚Ä¢	Brick & Mortar (Vijay Sales, Propel, Electricalsocity) remain significant.<br>
‚Ä¢	India delivers 4‚Äì6x higher revenue per customer vs. other markets.<br>

Example Query ‚Äì Top Customers in India<br>

SELECT c.customer,<br>
       ROUND(SUM(s.sold_quantity * g.gross_price)/1000000, 2) AS revenue_inr_mln,<br>
       c.platform<br>
FROM fact_sales_monthly s<br>
JOIN dim_customer c ON s.customer_code = c.customer_code<br>
JOIN fact_gross_price g ON s.product_code = g.product_code<br>
                       AND s.fiscal_year = g.fiscal_year<br>
WHERE c.market = 'India'<br>
GROUP BY c.customer, c.platform<br>
ORDER BY revenue_inr_mln DESC<br>
LIMIT 10;<br>

### üîπ Supply Chain Analysis<br>
‚Ä¢	Forecast accuracy ~45% vs. 80% target ‚Üí major inefficiencies.<br>
‚Ä¢	Even top accounts (Amazon, Walmart) show accuracy gaps.<br>
‚Ä¢	Opportunity to implement ML/AI forecasting models.<br>

Example Query ‚Äì Forecast Accuracy by Customer<br>

SELECT c.customer,<br>
       ROUND(SUM(f.forecast_quantity)/SUM(s.sold_quantity) * 100, 2) AS forecast_accuracy_pct<br>
FROM fact_sales_monthly s<br>
JOIN dim_customer c ON s.customer_code = c.customer_code<br>
JOIN fact_forecast_monthly f ON s.product_code = f.product_code<br>

                            AND s.date = f.date<br>
GROUP BY c.customer<br>
ORDER BY forecast_accuracy_pct ASC<br>
LIMIT 10;<br>

### üîπ Comparative Market Analysis<br>
‚Ä¢	India‚Äôs revenue grew ~35x (‚Çπ26M ‚Üí ‚Çπ910M) between 2018‚Äì2022.<br>
‚Ä¢	Other regions have larger customer bases but much lower per-customer revenue.<br>

Example Query ‚Äì Revenue Trend India vs. Other Markets<br>

SELECT fiscal_year,<br>
       SUM(CASE WHEN market = 'India' THEN s.sold_quantity * g.gross_price ELSE 0 END) AS india_revenue,<br>
       SUM(CASE WHEN market <> 'India' THEN s.sold_quantity * g.gross_price ELSE 0 END) AS other_revenue<br>
FROM fact_sales_monthly s<br>
JOIN dim_customer c ON s.customer_code = c.customer_code<br>
JOIN fact_gross_price g ON s.product_code = g.product_code<br>
                       AND s.fiscal_year = g.fiscal_year<br>
